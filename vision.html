    <h1>What Matters</h1>

    <div class="issue">
      <h2>Housing That Fits</h2>
      <p>
        Nibley is all about family and community. However our current housing diversity doesn't support all families and changes they will experience,
		from the high school graduate looking for their own place to the elderly couple looking to downsize. 
		I support zoning and land use policies that allow a variety of home sizes and types, so residents of all incomes and life stages can find a place to live here.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="issue">
      <h2>Support Local Business</h2>
      <p>
        There are so many entrepreneurs in Nibley and as they try to move their small business out of their garage they have little choice but to
		go to surrounding communities. Let’s focus on policies that support local, family-run businesses, allowing them to stay here. 
		I want to make it easier for small entrepreneurs to thrive in Nibley, helping to keep our economy resilient and rooted in the community.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="issue">
      <h2>Safe Streets for Everyone</h2>
      <p>
        Whether its walking their dog, a family bike ride, or kids getting to and from school — our community is always out and about.
		We can make	Nibley safer and more connected by designing our streets for people, not just cars. I support efforts to improve sidewalks,
		bike access, and walkability, so everyone from kids to seniors can get around safely.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="issue">
      <h2>Smart Growth, Strong Community</h2>
      <p>
        Nibley is growing — and we need to grow wisely. That means thoughtful planning, fiscally responsible development, and protecting the things that make this place special. I believe we can build a stronger future without losing what makes us Nibley.
