    <h1>Meet Troy</h1>
    <p>
	  I grew up in a small town on Maui, where my cousins and I could roam freely. After our first daughter 
	  was born, my wife and I hoped to raise her near family but the cost of housing made that impossible.
    </p>
    <p>
      In 2009, during the financial crisis, we moved to Utah with little more than a few suitcases. In 2016, 
	  we made Nibley our home. Our daughters have made great friends and memories here at school, in city sports, 
	  and at community events. But as they’ve grown up, I worry that they, along with their friends, may not be 
	  able to afford to stay in the place they love. We need to make sure Nibley remains a place people can 
	  afford to stay and thrive.
    </p>
    <p>
      Professionally, I'm a senior systems administrator. I’m used to solving complex problems and thinking about
	  how systems fit together. In my spare time, I’ve spent years studying city planning, housing, and land use
	  through reading, attending webinars and conferences, and staying involved in policy discussions. I am 
	  currently serving my second year on Nibley’s Planning Commission.
    </p>
	<p>
      I'm running for City Council because I want to build a city that works today and lasts for tomorrow. That means:
	  <ul>
		<li>Helping create homes for a range of family budgets</li>
		<li>Supporting local family-run businesses</li>
		<li>Making it easier for people to live near what matters</li>
	  </ul>
